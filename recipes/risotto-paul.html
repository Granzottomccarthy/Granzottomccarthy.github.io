<p>This special Risotto recipe was passed on to us by Nona (Giavona)Granzotto. It is a wonderful reminder of her, her parents before her, and our Italian heritage who shared this meal countless times with their families. Risotto has been a main staple in the Granzotto family for many generations and similar to the careful time it takes to prepare this meal, we are reminded of its likeness to giving the quality time and tender care to ourselves and our loved ones. Take the time to fold together these simple ingredients. Not too quickly! Don’t wait too long! Spend the right amount of time to prepare this wonderful meal so that it can be enjoyed. Feel free to add additional ingredients and spices as needed to meet your family’s taste.</p>
<p>Love, Paul, Alex and Tal</p>
