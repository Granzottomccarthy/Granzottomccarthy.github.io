<p>Cut the breast into 4 slices lengthwise and wrap a piece of meat around it.

<p>We were up north at a cabin with no spices and lots of great Italian meat (thanks Mom and Dad) and a package of chicken. This is the meal John came up with and it was very good.</p>
<p>It would also make a great appetizer.</p>
