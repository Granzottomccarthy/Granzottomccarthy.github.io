<p class="inst"><b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b></p>
<p>In a large kettle add water and bring to a boil.</p>
<p>Add all the ingredients, cover and boil for about 2 hours over low heat.</p>
<p>After 5 minutes, skim off any foam.</p>
<p>Note, the stock will taste a bit flat to you since it has no salt. Salt will be added when you use the stock in preparation of soups and sauces.</p>
<p>Remove the cooked chicken from the kettle and after it has cooled a little remove the skin and bones.
<p>Note: The meat is used as the meat dish POLO IN UMIDO for a main course with risotto or polenta. The broth can be used for preparing risotto or frozen for future use.</p>
<br>
<p>POLO IN UMIDO con pomodoro:
<p>Place the boneless chicken in a Pyrex container and cover with the remaining cooked sauce, from Nona Granzottos risotto recipe.
<p>Cover the container and place in the oven at medium temperature for 15 minutes or so before serving.</p>
<br>
<p>Note From James Granzotto: Nona made many uses of excess broth. By simply adding interesting types of macaroni, Stellini (stars), Alphabets and Orzo, she always made broth fun to eat.
<p>She always served broth to those of us recovering from illness. There was never any doubt, there was therapeutic value in chicken broth and she let us know it. Until there was signs of recovery that was the only food we got.</p>
